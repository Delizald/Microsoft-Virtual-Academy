Lesson 1: Active Directory DS.
	-LDAP
	-Based on TCP/IP
	-x.500 standard
	-client-server model

two components in Authentication(who you are. Process ):
	-Interactive logon
	-Network auth.

AD DS features:
	-Centralized Directory.
	-Single sign-on access.
	-Integrated security.
	-Scalability
	-Common Management interface
	-Single location for assigning access to shared network resources
	-Options for configuring security policies that apply to all users and pc's (Group Policy)
	
Requirements to install AD DS.
	-TCP/IP.
	-Credentials.
	-DNS. AD DS domain names must be DNS domain names. 

DNS zones can be stored in AD DS as AD integrated zones.

AD DS is composed of:
	-Physical components
		-Data Store
		-Domain Controllers
		-Global catalog server
		-Read-Only Domain Controller
	-Logical Components
		-Partitions
		-Schema
		-Domains
		-Domain tress
		-Forests
		-Sites
		Organizational Units
		
A Domain Controller is a server with the AD DS tole installed. Domain Controllers:
	-Host a copy of the AD DS directory sotre
	-provide authentication and authorization services
	-Replicate updates to other domain controllers in the domain and the forest
	-Allow administrative access to manage user accounts and network resources

Global catalog servers are DC that store a copy of the gloal catalog:
	-Contains a copy of all AD DS objects in a forest that includes
	some of the attributes for each object in a forest.
	-Improves efficency of object searches by avoiding unnecesary referrals to domain controllers.
	-Required for users to log on to domain.

AD DS Data store contains the database files and processes that store.
	-Consists of the Ntds.dit file.
	-Stored by default in th %SystemRoot%\NTDS folder on all DC.
	-Accesible only through DC processes and protocols

AD DS Replication copies all updates of the AD DS database to all other DCs in domain or forest.
	-Ensures all DCs have the same info.
	-Use a multimaster replication model.
	-Can be managed by creating AD DS sites.
	-Topology is created automatically as new DCs are added to domain.

AD DS site is used to represent network segments.
	-Associated with IP subnets.
	-Used to manage replication traffic.
	-Manage client logon traffic.
	-Used by site aware applications such as DFS or Exchange.
	-Used to assign group policy to all users and computers.
	
AD DS Schema
	-Defines every type of object that can be stored in the directory
	-Enforce rules regarding object creation and configuration
	
Domains are used to group and manage objects
	-Administrative boundary for applying policies.
	-Replication boundary for replicating data between DCs.
	-An authentication and authorization boundary that provides a way to limit access to resources.

A Domain Tree is a hierarchy of domains in AD DS.
	-Share contiguous namespace with the parent domain.
	-Can have additional child domains.
	-Create a two-way transistive trust with other domains.

Forests are a collection of one or mre domain trees.
	-Share a common schema.
	-Share a common configuration partition.
	-Share a common global catalog to enable searching.
	-Enable trusts between all domains in a forest.
	-Share enterprise admins and schema admins groups.

Organizational Units OUs are AD containers that contain users, groups, computers and others OUs
	-represent organization hierarchically and logically.
	-manage collection of objects.
	-delegate permissions to administer groups of objects.
	-apply policies.

Trusts provide a mechanism for users to gain access to resources in another domain
	-Directional: direction flows from trusting domain to the trusted domain.
	-Transitive: Extended beyond a two-domain trust to include other trusted domains.
