AD LDS is a hierarchical file based directory store
Uses the Extensible Storage Engine for file storage (ESE)
Can be accessed via LDAP

Partition types:
	-Configuration
	-Schema
	-Application

Tools
	-Wizard
		-Create a new instance od LDS
		-Create a replica of LDS instance
	-ADSIEdit
		-Modifying and viewing data
	-LDP
		-Creating application partition instances
		-Modifying data
		-Viewing data
	-Ldifde or Csvde
		-Importgind and exporting data
	-Dsacls
		-View or set permission
	-AdamSync
		-Syncronze and instance of AD DS to AD LDS
	-ADSChemaAnalyzer
		-Used in migrating the AD schema to ADAM
		

AD LDS Schema defines the types of objects and data that can be created and stored in a LDS instance using object classes and attributes

AD LDS instance is a running copy of AD LDS service that contains is own communication interface and directory store

Application partiions holds the data that is used by the application.
Multipple application directory partitions can be created in each LDS instance; each partition would share
a single set of configuration and schema partitions

Roles
	-Administrators: Full access to all partitions
	-Readers: Read access to the partition
	-Users: none
	-Instances
	
Why replication
	-High Availability
	-Load Balancing
	-Geographic limitations
	
Similarities with AD DS
	-Support LDAP connections
	-Multimaster replication
	-Support delegated administration
	-Extensible Storage Engine for the database store

LDs can:
	-Capable of multiple instances running on one server
	-runs on nondomain controllers
	-does not require DNS
	
LDS can't (but DS can):
	-Group Policy
	-Global Catalog functions
	-Kerberos V5 protocol authentication
	-Full feature administrator tools
	-Automatica failover of services
	
To integrate AD DS and AD LDS:
	-Prepare schema for synchronization
	-Prepare the configuration for AdamSync
	-Run AdamSync
